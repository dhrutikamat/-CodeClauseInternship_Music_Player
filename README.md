# CodeClauseInternship_Music_Player
This project provides a basic music player interface that allows users to start, pause, and resume songs from a list of songs in the current directory. The code uses the tkinter and pygame libraries to create the graphical interface and handle audio playback.
The code imports the necessary libraries, tkinter for the graphical user interface and pygame for audio playback. It also imports the 'os' and 'time' modules. The main application window is created using Tkinter.
The user interface includes a label, a control button, and a dropdown menu for song selection.
